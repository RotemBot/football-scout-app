### Data Flow
1. User enters freetext search in Vue.js frontend
2. Frontend sends request to Express API
3. API uses OpenAI to parse freetext into structured search parameters
4. Crawling jobs are queued for each target website (in reliability order)
5. Puppeteer crawlers extract player data from primary sources
6. **Cross-verification engine** compares player data across sources
7. **Dynamic source discovery** identifies additional relevant sources
8. **Data consolidation** creates unified player profiles with confidence scores
9. Results are progressively sent to frontend via WebSockets (as verification completes)
10. Verified data is cached in Redis and stored in PostgreSQL

  };

  async verifyPlayerData(playerData: SourceData[]): Promise<PlayerResult> {
    const consolidated = this.consolidateData(playerData);
    const conflicts = this.detectConflicts(playerData);
    const confidence = this.calculateConfidence(playerData, conflicts);
    
    return {
      ...consolidated,
      confidence,
      verificationStatus: this.getVerificationStatus(conflicts, confidence),
      conflictingData: conflicts
    };
  }

  private consolidateData(sources: SourceData[]): Partial<PlayerResult> {
    // Prioritize data from most reliable sources
    // Handle conflicts using weighted voting
  }

  private detectConflicts(sources: SourceData[]): ConflictingField[] {
    // Identify fields with different values across sources
  }

  private calculateConfidence(sources: SourceData[], conflicts: ConflictingField[]): number {
    // Calculate confidence based on source reliability and conflict resolution
  }
}
```

### 5. Dynamic Source Discovery

    'espn.com', 'goal.com', 'skysports.com', 'bbc.com/sport',
    'marca.com', 'as.com', 'gazzetta.it', 'kicker.de'
  ];

  async discoverAdditionalSources(playerName: string, currentClub: string): Promise<string[]> {
    const searchQueries = this.generateSearchQueries(playerName, currentClub);
    const discoveredUrls = await this.searchForSources(searchQueries);
    return this.filterValidSources(discoveredUrls);
  }

  private isValidFootballSource(url: string): boolean {
    return this.knownFootballSites.some(site => url.includes(site));
  }
}
```

### 6. Real-time Communication
```typescript
// WebSocket events
interface SearchEvents {
  'search:started': { searchId: string; searchParams: SearchParameters };
  'search:progress': { searchId: string; progress: number; currentSource: string };
  'search:result': { searchId: string; player: PlayerResult }; // Includes matchExplanation
  'search:completed': { searchId: string; totalResults: number; summary: SearchSummary };
  'search:error': { searchId: string; error: string };
}

interface SearchSummary {
  totalPlayersFound: number;
  averageMatchStrength: number;
  sourcesSearched: string[];
  timeElapsed: number;
  topMatchReasons: string[]; // Most common reasons for matches
}
```

## Environment Setup Options

### Option 1: Local Setup (Simpler)
**Pros:**
- Faster development iteration
- No Docker overhead
- Direct access to databases
- Simpler debugging

**Requirements:**
- Node.js 18+ installed locally
- PostgreSQL installed locally
- Redis installed locally
- Environment variables in `.env` file

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL (macOS)
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

# Install Redis (macOS)
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Option 2: Docker Setup (Isolated)
**Pros:**
- Consistent environment across machines
- Easy database setup
- Isolated dependencies
- Production-like environment

**Requirements:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- docker-compose.yml configuration

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Install dependencies
docker-compose exec backend npm install
```

### Recommendation
**Start with Option 1 (Local Setup)** for simplicity. You can always migrate to Docker later if needed for deployment or team collaboration.

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel Crawling**: Run multiple crawlers simultaneously
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache frequently searched players
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect website rate limits to avoid blocking
- **Resource Management**: Optimize memory usage with connection pooling

### Security & Ethics
- **Website Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with scraping policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement respectful crawling practices
- **Data Privacy**: Secure handling of search queries and results
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when websites are unavailable

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design for multiple crawler instances
- **Database Optimization**: Index frequently queried fields
- **Queue Management**: Handle high-volume search requests
- **CDN Integration**: Optimize asset delivery

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- **Health Checks**: Monitor crawler success rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times and accuracy
- **Website Changes**: Detect and adapt to website structure changes
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and alerting

## Development Timeline

**Total Estimated Time**: 6 weeks

**Week 1**: Core infrastructure setup
**Week 2**: AI integration and search logic
**Week 3**: Web crawling engine development
**Week 4**: Data processing and storage
**Week 5**: Frontend development and UX
**Week 6**: Testing, optimization, and deployment

## Success Metrics

- **Search Accuracy**: >80% relevant results per search
- **Response Time**: <30 seconds for initial results
- **Crawler Reliability**: >95% uptime across all sources
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on result quality
- **System Performance**: Handle 100+ concurrent searches
- **Explanation Quality**: >85% of explanations rated as "helpful" by users
- **Match Strength Accuracy**: Average match strength correlates with user ratings

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Improve search relevance with ML models
- **Video Integration**: Embed player highlight videos
- **Advanced Analytics**: Player performance predictions
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
- **API Access**: Public API for third-party integrations

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Website Changes**: Regular monitoring and crawler updates
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement robust retry mechanisms
- **Data Quality**: Validation and cleaning processes

### Legal Risks
- **Terms of Service**: Legal review of scraping activities
- **Data Usage**: Ensure compliance with data protection laws
- **Copyright**: Respect intellectual property rights

### Operational Risks
- **Downtime**: Implement redundancy and failover systems
- **Scalability**: Design for growth from the beginning
- **Maintenance**: Plan for ongoing updates and improvements
